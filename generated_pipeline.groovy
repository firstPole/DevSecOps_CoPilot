To create a secure Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a Java application that will be deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), we will incorporate several stages focused on security, monitoring, maintainability, and scalability. This pipeline will include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), image scanning, Kubernetes security scanning, and monitoring. The following is a sample Jenkins pipeline configuration that implements these best practices:

### Jenkinsfile

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        // Define environment variables
        AZURE_CREDENTIALS = credentials('azure-credentials-id')
        DOCKER_IMAGE = 'my-java-app:latest'
        AKS_CLUSTER = 'my-aks-cluster'
        K8S_NAMESPACE = 'my-namespace'
        SAST_TOOL = 'sast-tool-command' // Placeholder for SAST tool command
        DAST_TOOL = 'dast-tool-command' // Placeholder for DAST tool command
        IMAGE_SCAN_TOOL = 'image-scan-tool' // Placeholder for image scanning tool
        K8S_SECURITY_TOOL = 'k8s-security-scan-tool' // Placeholder for Kubernetes security scanning tool
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout source code from version control
                git url: 'https://github.com/your-repo/my-java-app.git', branch: 'main'
            }
        }

        stage('SAST') {
            steps {
                // Run SAST tool
                sh "${SAST_TOOL} ./src"
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the Java application
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Image Build & Scan') {
            steps {
                // Build Docker image
                script {
                    sh 'docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE .'
                }
                // Scan Docker image for vulnerabilities
                sh "${IMAGE_SCAN_TOOL} $DOCKER_IMAGE"
            }
        }

        stage('DAST') {
            steps {
                // Deploy the application to a temporary environment for DAST
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml -n $K8S_NAMESPACE'
                // Run DAST tool
                sh "${DAST_TOOL} http://temporary-env-url"
            }
        }

        stage('K8s Security Scan') {
            steps {
                // Perform Kubernetes security scan
                sh "${K8S_SECURITY_TOOL} -f k8s/deployment.yaml"
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to AKS') {
            steps {
                // Deploy to AKS
                withCredentials([azureServicePrincipal(credentialsId: 'azure-credentials-id', subscriptionIdVariable: 'AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID')]) {
                    sh 'az aks get-credentials --resource-group my-resource-group --name $AKS_CLUSTER'
                    sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml -n $K8S_NAMESPACE'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Monitor') {
            steps {
                // Set up monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
                // This is a placeholder; actual implementation may vary based on your monitoring setup
                echo 'Setting up monitoring for AKS cluster...'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Clean up resources (if needed)
            sh 'kubectl delete -f k8s/deployment.yaml -n $K8S_NAMESPACE'
        }
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed, please check the logs!'
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Pipeline Stages:

1. **Checkout**: Retrieves the source code from a Git repository.

2. **SAST**: Runs a Static Application Security Testing tool on the source code to identify potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Build**: Builds the Java application using Maven.

4. **Image Build & Scan**: Builds a Docker image of the application and scans it for vulnerabilities.

5. **DAST**: Deploys the application to a temporary environment and runs a Dynamic Application Security Testing tool against it.

6. **K8s Security Scan**: Scans the Kubernetes deployment configuration for security best practices.

7. **Deploy to AKS**: Deploys the Docker image to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using `kubectl`.

8. **Monitor**: Sets up monitoring for the AKS cluster (the specific approach will depend on your monitoring tools).

### Security Considerations:
- Use `withCredentials` to securely manage Azure credentials.
- Ensure that all tools used in the pipeline are kept up-to-date and configured correctly.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for AKS to limit permissions.
- Set resource limits and requests for Kubernetes pods to avoid resource exhaustion.

### Monitoring and Maintenance:
- Consider integrating tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- Implement automated scaling policies based on resource usage.
- Set up alerts for critical issues in the AKS cluster.

### Scalability:
- Use Horizontal Pod Autoscalers to automatically scale your application based on demand.
- Ensure that your application is stateless to facilitate scaling.

This Jenkins pipeline provides a comprehensive approach to CI/CD with security, monitoring, and maintainability in mind, ensuring that your Java application can be deployed securely and efficiently to AKS.
